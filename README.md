# runs_bot
This is the current code for the Runs/Dynasty bot that runs on the TLD Discord server
This is by no means perfect code and was slapped together in my free time.

Just add your discord token and your guild id to the code, setup your discord bot for use with slash commands, all intents, and bot permissions, and you just need to run the main file. Voila
